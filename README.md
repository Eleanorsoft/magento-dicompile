# Eleanorsoft_DiCompile
Speed up Magento2 DI compilation

This module caches file lists during compilation to avoid expensive filesystem scans. Speed improvement is about 40% to 50%.

## Installation
* Copy `Eleanorsoft` folder to `app/code/`.
* Run `setup:upgrade`.
* Run `setup:di:compile`.

After compilation, you should see a folder `var/di_cache/` with 4 (or more) files. This is the actual cache. From now your compilation process will use these cached lists instead of scanning the whole filesystem.

**Note 1:** these caches contain only core files. All custom modules will be scanned each time as usual.

**Note 2:** if you upgrade Magento 2, delete these files because core modules could change during the upgrade.
